 ### The Story Behind
 These are two things that I love, it is what this playground is about; coffee and art.
 
  In my city, there are a lot of cafes.. I want to explore lots of them because I want to try the different varieties of food and drinks they serve. But among those, there is one coffee shop that I love the most. It served delicious coffee and cakes and not to mention the atmosphere, it is a good place to chill or even work. I wonder what their secret ingredient is. I've always wanted to work there because I want to mix their different ingredients, maybe make a new menu.
 
I also love to draw. I consider it a new talent I developed not-so-long ago.  Back then at school I thought my drawings were awful, but after spending many months at home, I feel like getting better at it, and now I like my drawings.
The art style of this playground is what i think people will draw when they are chilling in coffee shop, just simple sketches.
 
 
I was introduced to UiKit when I was in academy, but I didn't learn SwiftUI. SwiftUI was an uncharted teritory for me, so making this was a real challenge. I made this playground to combine the things I love and usually do with a thing I never did and didn't understand.
 
The experience of making this was quite a ride from start to finish. There are moments where I messed up the drawings or forget what I code the night before, then came back confused on where to continue. I thought I wouldn't finish this in time. But I'm so glad I can understand some codes in swift quickly and finish this project. This makes me really excited to learn more about swift and coding. Now I want to hone this new skill of mine.
 
 ### Techs I Used
 
**UIKit** : to create the view with this size

 **SwiftUI** : UIKit, I've used. This guy, is new to me! have the chance to learn and built something with this framework -> my WWDC21 submission.

 **animation** : okay , I thought that all animations must be in form of assets even the simplest one, like have to be drawn frame by frame, but with SwiftUi like you can do it? WOW
